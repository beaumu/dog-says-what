## Installation

```sh
npm install dog-says-what
```

## Usage

```js
const dogSaysWhat = require("dog-says-what");

dogSaysWhat();
```

## Dependencies

Uses [Colors.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) under the hood to make the text more colorful.

## Origin story

I was fooling around with creating a package and my thought was to make something useless. But u can use it to check if your node runs. If it runs, you will see something in the terminal.
